Hi dhanraj please find the formula for the added five columns in the sheet:



1.  `signed_decayed` -----------------------



  Formula



df['forecast_decay_factor'] = np.exp(-0.15 * (df['remaining_months'] - 1))
df['signed_decayed'] = df['committed_signed'] * df['forecast_decay_factor']



Deals that are signed but far in the future are:



* more likely to be delayed
* more likely to be renegotiated
* less reliable for near-term forecasts



2.`revenue_macd` --------------------------------



""short-term revenue trend − long-term revenue trend""
formula:
df['revenue_macd'] = df['actual_revenue'].shift(1).ewm(span=3, adjust=False).mean() - df['actual_revenue'].shift(1).ewm(span=6, adjust=False).mean()





  Business meaning



This shows whether  revenue momentum is accelerating or slowing .



  Why it matters



* Positive → growth speeding up
* Negative → growth slowing down
* Early warning before totals change



  Business interpretation: Is our revenue trend improving or weakening right now



3. log_signed_monthly ------------------------------



  Formula

log(1 + signed_monthly_run_rate)
 


df['signed_monthly_run_rate'] = df['committed_signed'] / df['remaining_months']
df['log_signed_monthly'] = np.log1p(df['signed_monthly_run_rate'])



  Business meaning



This compresses extreme values so  big deals don’t dominate the model .



  Why it matters



* Revenue is skewed (a few very large deals)
* Log scaling makes patterns more stable
* Helps model general behavior, not outliers





4. pipeline_forecast_volatility` ----------------------------------



  Formula



```python
3-month rolling std of pipeline % change
```
df['pipeline_forecast_volatility'] = df['wtd_pipeline'].pct_change().rolling(3, min_periods=1).std()





  Business meaning



This measures  how unstable or volatile the pipeline is .



  Why it matters



* Highly volatile pipeline = unreliable forecast
* Stable pipeline = higher confidence



  Business interpretation: How much is our pipeline jumping around month to month.



5.  unsigned_monthly_run_rate  ------------------------------------------



  Formula



```python
committed_signed / remaining_months
```



    df['unsigned_monthly_run_rate'] = df['committed_unsigned'] / df['remaining_months']





  Business meaning



This is the  monthly revenue pace implied by unsigned deals .



  Why it matters



* Shows execution pressure
* Highlights unrealistic targets late in the year
* Core anchor for forecasting



  Business interpretation: At what monthly pace are unsigned deals contributing to revenue.
