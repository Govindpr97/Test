00:00:57.401 --> 00:01:02.975
<v Rucha Pattnaik>If I project code client code,
I think we are using client code. Yes,</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/15-1
00:01:02.975 --> 00:01:08.947
<v Rucha Pattnaik>project code can it's somewhat empty,
but client code will never be empty.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/15-2
00:01:08.947 --> 00:01:14.361
<v Rucha Pattnaik>That's why we are using client code and
we parent client basically.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/17-0
00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:22.878
<v Rucha Pattnaik>Client client name.
Then comes the major expense head name.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/17-1
00:01:22.878 --> 00:01:34.241
<v Rucha Pattnaik>OK, IMU, IMU Level 3, IML level one name,
SU level 5, we use SU level one name. OK.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/18-0
00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:39.793

00:01:39.793 --> 00:01:44.435
<v Rucha Pattnaik>The market level name being no use,
market level one name,</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/18-2
00:01:44.435 --> 00:01:49.157

00:01:52.081 --> 00:01:59.588

00:01:59.588 --> 00:02:07.603
<v Rucha Pattnaik>financial planning and analysis team,
he gave value weighted pipeline category</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/19-2
00:02:07.603 --> 00:02:08.921
<v Rucha Pattnaik>and it's not.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/20-0
00:02:08.921 --> 00:02:16.135
<v Rucha Pattnaik>A very good feature. OK,
this is a swag or guest feature factual</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/20-1
00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:21.684
<v Rucha Pattnaik>backing.
But if this is the sole predictor of the</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/20-2
00:02:21.684 --> 00:02:27.121
<v Rucha Pattnaik>revenue,
then there is some something wrong, OK?</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/21-0
00:02:28.321 --> 00:02:35.841
<v Rucha Pattnaik>But you can use if you want clear until
here the probability percentage.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/22-0
00:02:37.361 --> 00:02:48.081
<v Govind Kumar>Yeah, yeah, clear,
but can you wait pipeline can accept ID.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/24-0
00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:57.673
<v Rucha Pattnaik>It's quite ignore column weighted
pipeline consider that to be even if</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/23-0
00:02:57.481 --> 00:02:58.121

00:02:57.673 --> 00:03:00.481
<v Rucha Pattnaik>you're considering for.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/25-1
00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.481
<v Debasish Sahoo>Ankit Ku and Claude Nikya.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/26-0
00:03:07.281 --> 00:03:13.961
<v Rucha Pattnaik>Start revision.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/27-0
00:03:14.401 --> 00:03:17.201
<v Debasish Sahoo>OK, OK, OK. It's a refresher one. OK,
cricketing.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/28-0
00:03:18.441 --> 00:03:20.241
<v Debasish Sahoo>Bigger than OK, Karen, Karen.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/29-0
00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:21.081
<v Rucha Pattnaik>No.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/30-0
00:03:22.041 --> 00:03:29.098
<v Rucha Pattnaik>So probability percentage is backing me
analyst taking their domain knowledge,</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/30-1
00:03:29.098 --> 00:03:35.619
<v Rucha Pattnaik>past experience and everything.
They are giving a value OK a probability</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/30-2
00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:41.961
<v Rucha Pattnaik>value lesser than one. So is 0.
1 into 100 it will be 10% one to into.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/31-0
00:03:43.201 --> 00:03:47.805
<v Rucha Pattnaik>OK, something will be there.
OK And you are saying there are nonzero</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/31-1
00:03:47.805 --> 00:03:52.609
<v Rucha Pattnaik>values for other categories too that
committed E sub completely ignore.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/31-2
00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:57.880
<v Rucha Pattnaik>Basically this is not a valid column but
somewhat you can use for the weighted</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/31-3
00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.081
<v Rucha Pattnaik>pipeline but main.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/32-0
00:04:00.681 --> 00:04:02.481
<v Govind Kumar>Mm-hmm. OK.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/33-0
00:04:02.521 --> 00:04:06.521
<v Rucha Pattnaik>Probability percentage.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/37-0
00:04:07.681 --> 00:04:16.026
<v Govind Kumar>This project will start weighted
pipelines, yes. OK,</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/34-0
00:04:12.081 --> 00:04:12.401
<v Rucha Pattnaik>Right.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/35-0
00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:15.041
<v Rucha Pattnaik>Hmm.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/37-1
00:04:16.026 --> 00:04:22.481
<v Govind Kumar>so probability 50% 20% revenue generated.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/36-0
00:04:21.121 --> 00:04:22.001
<v Rucha Pattnaik>All right.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/38-0

00:04:27.321 --> 00:04:39.721
<v Govind Kumar>So feature create feature.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/39-0
00:04:27.841 --> 00:04:29.121
<v Rucha Pattnaik>Correct. Um.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/42-0
00:04:41.001 --> 00:04:50.410
<v Rucha Pattnaik>Correct per month per month average.
You can try other aggregation functions</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/41-0
00:04:41.401 --> 00:04:43.761
<v Govind Kumar>Because it's kind of like a gaze, yeah.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/42-1
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:56.641
<v Rucha Pattnaik>like median mode but since it's a
numerical value.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/43-0
00:04:56.961 --> 00:05:05.361
<v Rucha Pattnaik>Median Uh, I had tried. It didn't work,
but you can again retry. OK.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/44-0
00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:08.281
<v Govind Kumar>Average Melia was.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/45-0
00:05:08.161 --> 00:05:08.201
<v Rucha Pattnaik>50%.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/46-0
00:05:09.201 --> 00:05:14.068
<v Debasish Sahoo>And see, while taking this thing,
one more thing to consider,</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/46-1
00:05:14.068 --> 00:05:18.934
<v Debasish Sahoo>it's gonna range and it's like few of
them are in percentage,</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/46-2
00:05:18.934 --> 00:05:21.681
<v Debasish Sahoo>few of few of them are in fraction.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/47-0
00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:25.521
<v Debasish Sahoo>OK, but they call.</v>

00:05:27.721 --> 00:05:31.721
<v Debasish Sahoo>Which has 0.10.2,
they're actually 10 percent, 20%.</v>

00:05:36.121 --> 00:05:42.081
<v Rucha Pattnaik>Some values are greater than 1550.</v>

00:05:50.681 --> 00:05:53.561
<v Debasish Sahoo>Less than equal to one, right?
So that's a fraction.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/58-0
00:05:51.521 --> 00:05:51.681

00:09:06.965 --> 00:09:14.170
<v Rucha Pattnaik>you are predicting a stock price. OK,
there is a 50% probability that after the</v>

00:09:16.601 --> 00:09:24.853
<v Rucha Pattnaik>The stock price will go like 1500 per

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/101-1
00:09:24.853 --> 00:09:34.783
<v Rucha Pattnaik>you're not doing 1500 into 0.5.
This is a probability 50% chance 1500,</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/101-2
00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:36.321

01:21:09.361 --> 01:21:11.161
<v Rucha Pattnaik>I had a call with Ankit.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/900-0
01:21:58.841 --> 01:22:06.121
<v Rucha Pattnaik>OK, P means probability, C means count.
Clear both of you.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/901-0
01:22:07.801 --> 01:22:08.001
<v Govind Kumar>Yeah.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/903-0
01:22:09.601 --> 01:22:16.921
<v Rucha Pattnaik>And win or lose will be like yes or no,
one or zero days. So ye month.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/902-0
01:22:14.681 --> 01:22:15.161
<v Govind Kumar>Mhm.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/904-0
01:22:18.841 --> 01:22:18.881
<v Rucha Pattnaik>Uh.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/905-0
01:22:20.961 --> 01:22:22.041
<v Rucha Pattnaik>Let's say April.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/906-0
01:22:24.561 --> 01:22:30.481
<v Rucha Pattnaik>Uh, might not be a good example,
but let's try on this April, May.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/907-0
01:22:32.201 --> 01:22:33.081
<v Rucha Pattnaik>Uh, let's say.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/908-0
01:22:35.601 --> 01:22:42.481
<v Rucha Pattnaik>User Kaik name. User name. Yeah,
participant name is select.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/913-0
01:22:50.241 --> 01:23:04.509
<v Rucha Pattnaik>Taram then S April.
Problem statement versus based on number</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/913-1
01:23:04.509 --> 01:23:07.081
<v Rucha Pattnaik>of diamond.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/914-0
01:23:07.681 --> 01:23:12.418
<v Rucha Pattnaik>Yeah,
combination of something win and less</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/914-1
01:23:12.418 --> 01:23:19.738
<v Rucha Pattnaik>combination who have done good,
you know you count the probability,</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/914-2
01:23:19.738 --> 01:23:23.721
<v Rucha Pattnaik>they will win. OK, you might not win.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/915-0
01:23:24.001 --> 01:23:29.172
<v Rucha Pattnaik>I know it's a bit loose ended, not a,
you know, good example,</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/915-1
01:23:29.172 --> 01:23:33.759
<v Rucha Pattnaik>but I just want to explain you
probability percentage.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/915-2
01:23:33.759 --> 01:23:40.681
<v Rucha Pattnaik>Even if we are taking committed signed,
unsigned, I'm trying to set up that thing.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/917-0
01:23:40.841 --> 01:23:56.561
<v Rucha Pattnaik>April May diamond count count then spade
count 5 then count 7.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/916-0
01:23:41.681 --> 01:23:41.921
Hmm.

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/918-0
01:23:56.961 --> 01:24:09.633
<v Rucha Pattnaik>Then club count 4 then diamond
probability. Let's say 13 into four,</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/918-1
01:24:09.633 --> 01:24:12.801
<v Rucha Pattnaik>right? 5213 four.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/920-0
01:24:14.441 --> 01:24:24.298
<v Rucha Pattnaik>Diamond, let's say 2 by 13.
Just I'm taking roughly, yeah, 3 by 13.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/920-1
01:24:24.298 --> 01:24:30.241
<v Rucha Pattnaik>Yeah, something 7 by 13. So bear with me.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/921-0
01:24:31.401 --> 01:24:33.441
<v Rucha Pattnaik>And 6 by 13.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/922-0
01:24:35.041 --> 01:24:42.321
<v Rucha Pattnaik>OK. And for the month of April,
Sara ka win to win or lose one.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/923-0
01:24:43.641 --> 01:24:44.281
<v Rucha Pattnaik>Samjay.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/924-0
01:24:45.241 --> 01:24:45.721
<v Govind Kumar>Mhm.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/925-0
01:24:46.721 --> 01:24:57.801
<v Rucha Pattnaik>Similarly and.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/926-0
01:24:59.001 --> 01:25:11.198
<v Rucha Pattnaik>She won. OK,
so data model and training data then</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/926-1
01:25:11.198 --> 01:25:13.881
<v Rucha Pattnaik>prediction.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/929-0
01:25:26.881 --> 01:25:31.281
<v Rucha Pattnaik>Let's say.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/930-0
01:25:33.321 --> 01:25:43.723
<v Rucha Pattnaik>June 112,
she lost here in the month of May 125948</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/930-1
01:25:43.723 --> 01:25:47.801
<v Rucha Pattnaik>by 13 so it's go up.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/931-0
01:25:49.441 --> 01:25:56.719
<v Rucha Pattnaik>This and model feed for prediction.
So what will be the you know result?</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/931-1
01:25:56.719 --> 01:26:04.196
<v Rucha Pattnaik>Whether Sara will win in or lose in the
month of June or what will happen?</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/931-2
01:26:04.196 --> 01:26:08.881
<v Rucha Pattnaik>The model has to predict count or
probability.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/932-0
01:26:09.001 --> 01:26:14.656
<v Rucha Pattnaik>Basically you can say diamond count or
diamond probability.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/932-1
01:26:14.656 --> 01:26:22.384
<v Rucha Pattnaik>They will be somewhat related, correct?
So diamond count and diamond probability.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/932-2
01:26:22.384 --> 01:26:27.001
<v Rucha Pattnaik>Probability is spade count or spade
probability.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/934-0
01:26:27.521 --> 01:26:30.521
<v Rucha Pattnaik>Correct. The combined effect of huh.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/933-0
01:26:28.921 --> 01:26:30.321
<v Govind Kumar>Sorry.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/935-0
01:26:31.881 --> 01:26:34.361
<v Govind Kumar>Sara independent event days. Mm-hmm.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/937-0
01:26:32.441 --> 01:26:41.708
<v Rucha Pattnaik>The the combined effect of all these
features is contributing to your result,</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/937-1
01:26:41.708 --> 01:26:49.310
<v Rucha Pattnaik>whether win or lose. OK,
it's not a diamond counter probability</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/936-0
01:26:43.161 --> 01:26:43.721
<v Govind Kumar>Mhm.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/937-2
01:26:49.310 --> 01:26:52.161
<v Rucha Pattnaik>and counter probability.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/938-0
01:26:52.161 --> 01:26:57.459
<v Rucha Pattnaik>Similarly,
weighted pipeline revenue or probability</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/938-1
01:26:57.459 --> 01:27:03.470
<v Rucha Pattnaik>percentage committed,
signed or committed unsigned revenue</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/938-2
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:09.481
<v Rucha Pattnaik>because they are also contributing to the
monthly revenue.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/939-0
01:27:10.361 --> 01:27:10.881
<v Rucha Pattnaik>Samjay.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/940-0
01:27:16.841 --> 01:27:17.561
<v Rucha Pattnaik>It OK.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/941-0
01:27:17.121 --> 01:27:19.081
<v Govind Kumar>Hmm. Clear.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/942-0
01:27:20.081 --> 01:27:20.401
<v Rucha Pattnaik>Or Kuch out.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/943-0
01:27:22.681 --> 01:27:28.521
<v Govind Kumar>Nayabitani, like in a girl,
Krish out weather.</v>

9487bb21-f3d6-4064-88be-d10eb2c8a9ee/944-0
01:27:36.441 --> 01:27:37.121
<v Govind Kumar>Hmm.</v>
